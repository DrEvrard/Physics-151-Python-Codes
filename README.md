# Physics-151-Python-Codes

This is where Python codes created for the Chadron State College Physics 151 course will be uploaded.
The names of the code files will be self explanatory as to what the codes solve, and students will be
able to match the code file with the topics we will cover in class. Anyone else looking at these codes
will also be able to tell what they are for and what they solve from the name of the file and the 
commenting within the codes themselves.
